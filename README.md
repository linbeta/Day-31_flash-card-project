This is the Day-31 capstone project from the Udemy online course: [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Aangela Yu.

The Flash Card app is a useful tool to memorise something.
In this version, the data is used 100 frequently used French-English words so that user could practice French.


In my own version, I developed a japanese branch which used [the 1,000 Japanese basic words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:1000_Japanese_basic_words) list in the [Wiktionary:Frequency lists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists#Japanese) that I can use this app to practice Japanese.


If anyone is interested in Learning a language by the flash card method, you could modify the code and load your list of words to practice.
